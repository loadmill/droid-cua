**Minimal AI agent that controls Android devices using OpenAI‚Äôs computer-use-preview model.**

---

## üöÄ How It Works

1. Connects to a running Android emulator.
2. Captures full-screen device screenshots.
3. Scales down the screenshots for OpenAI model compatibility.
4. Sends screenshots and user instructions to OpenAI‚Äôs computer-use-preview model.
5. Receives structured actions (click, scroll, type, keypress, wait, drag).
6. Rescales model outputs back to real device coordinates.
7. Executes the actions on the device.
8. Repeats until you type `exit`.

## üõ† Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:
   ```sh
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key" > .env
   ```

3. Make sure Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is available in your system PATH:
   ```sh
   adb version
   ```

4. Start your Android emulator manually (optional):
   ```sh
   emulator -avd Your_AVD_Name
   ```

5. Run the agent:
   ```sh
   node index.js --avd=Your_AVD_Name
   ```

   If no `--avd` is provided, the agent will try to connect to the first running device.

## üß† Features

- Captures screenshots directly from the device (`adb exec-out screencap -p`).
- Dynamically scales screenshots for OpenAI compatibility.
- Maps model-generated actions (click, scroll, drag, type, keypress, wait) back to real device coordinates.
- Connects automatically to a running emulator or launches it if needed.
- Pretends the device screen is embedded inside a browser page for environment compatibility.

## üìÑ Command Line Flags

| Flag | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| `--avd=AVD_NAME` | Select the emulator device by AVD name. |
| `--instructions=FILENAME` | Load user instructions from a text file. |

---

## üìã Example Usage

Start your emulator:

```sh
emulator -avd Pixel_5_API_34
```

Run the agent:

```sh
node index.js --avd=Pixel_5_API_34
```

Run with an instructions file:

```sh
node index.js --avd=Pixel_5_API_34 --instructions=example.txt
```

Example `example.txt`:

```
Open Chrome
Search for "Loadmill"
Scroll down
Go back to the home screen
exit
```

## üì¶ Requirements

- Node.js 18 or higher
- A running Android emulator (AVD)
- Android Debug Bridge (ADB) installed and available in system PATH
- OpenAI Tier 3 access for the computer-use-preview model

> [!NOTE]  
> Your OpenAI account must be **Tier 3** to access the computer-use-preview model.

## üìÅ Project Structure

| File         | Responsibility |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `index.js`   | Manages user input, OpenAI conversation, and main loop. |
| `device.js`  | ADB device connection, screenshot capture, screen size management. |
| `actions.js` | Executes model actions on the device (tap, swipe, drag, type, keypress). |
| `openai.js`  | Sends requests to OpenAI and manages API responses. |
